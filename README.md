Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of systematic engineering which involves system design, development, testing , deployment and maintenance of the software system.
The impotance of software engineering include; software engineering has led to continous innovation in technological solutions, software engineering has led to global connectivity and communication which improves spread and accessibility of information. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
i. Software engineering evolution has led to development of programming languages eg Fortran
ii. Software engineering evolution has led to the development of methodologies adopted in software engineering such as software development life cycle, waterfall model etc
iii. Software development evolution has led to the development of mobile technology like android. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
i. Planning and analysis - gathering the system requirements from clients and stakeholders.
ii. Define Requirements - converting the information gathered in the planning phase and into clear requirements of the phase.
iii. Design - crearting detailed and high-level detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
iv. Testing - conducting tests to ensure the software meets quality standars and functional requirements
v. Deployment - launching the software to users/clients.
vi. Maintaenance - providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software syatem after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
i. Roles; Waterfall strictly assigns roles to project team members, with specific duties and responsibilities defined for each team member. In contrast, the agile model empowers team members to collaborate on different aspects of the project over time, leading to a more self-organizing team structure.
ii. Planning; In waterfall, planning is a linear process done at the beginning of the project, with all requirements and objectives laid out in detail upfront. In contrast, agile planning is a continuous process throughout the project's life cycle, with adjustments made as new information or requirements emerge.
iii. Time frames; The waterfall method is designed for long-term projects with predetermined timelines. The project is completed linearly, with each phase dependent on the previous one. Agile, however, uses short iterations to deliver value rapidly, allowing teams to adjust plans over time and achieve shorter time frames.
iv. Speed; Waterfall projects tend to take longer because all requirements must be agreed upon before development can begin. Agile projects, on the other hand, are usually delivered more rapidly than waterfall projects due to the iterative development cycles used in agile.
v. Testing; Testing is essential to the agile and waterfall methodologies, but the approaches differ significantly. Agile emphasizes incremental testing to identify and resolve issues throughout the development process. In waterfall, testing is usually done at specific milestones, often towards the end of the project.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a) Software Developer; Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
b) Quality Assurance Engineer; Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
c) Project Manager; Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA) while Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
The challenges that software engineers face are;
i. Changing Requirements - requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
ii. Tight Deadlines - pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
iii. Technical Debt - accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

Ways to overcome these challenges include;
i. Changing Requirements - effective communication in reagrds to project goals and timelines.
ii. Tight Deadlines -  prioritization of tasks
iii. Technical Debt -  regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
i. Unit Testing - testing individual components or modules of software to help in automated testing.
ii. Integration Testing - testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
iii. System Testing - testing the entire software system as a whole to help identify and fix defects early in the development process.
iv. Acceptance Testing - testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. Prompt engineering helps to make your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt; Can TB make people healthy eating.
Improved Prompt; Ways in which healthy eating can help prevent TB.
The improved prompt is simple, clear and direct to help the AI to bring the desired results.
